      "message": "ssifbridge daemon just acts like a bridge between kernel bmc-ssif driver and ipmid in userland to send requests and receive responses. This command as defined by IPMI 2.0 spec is used to provide the System Interface capabilities supported in this BMC then host can be aware of what are supported in this interface. For example, SSIF/KCS/SMIC, and if it\u0027s SSIF, whether Multi-part read/write supported?, maximum size of IPMI message for a transaction?, PEC supported?. I think the BMC itself should provide that information and this is the right place to put. Moreover, the command be read out-of-band, not only inband.",
